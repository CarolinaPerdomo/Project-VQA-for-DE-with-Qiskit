### Proyect-VQA-for-DE-with-Qiskit
# This is a little [toy] proyect to practice Variational Quantum Algorithms with Qiskit.
# In particular, I want to solve a very simple differential equations using the Hybrid Classical-Quantum algorithm in ["here"](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.103.052416)
# Status: On course :alarm_clock:.
